  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder which is characterized by impaired communication, and limited social interactions. The shortcomings of current clinical approaches which are based exclusively on behavioral observation of symptomology, and poor understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying ASD necessitates the identification of new biomarkers that can aid in study of brain development, and functioning, and can lead to accurate and early detection of ASD. In this paper, we developed a deep-learning model called ASD-SAENet for classifying patients with ASD from typical control subjects using fMRI data. We designed and implemented a sparse autoencoder (SAE) which results in optimized extraction of features that can be used for classification. These features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) which results in superior classification of fMRI brain scans more prone to ASD. Our proposed model is trained to optimize the classifier while improving extracted features based on both reconstructed data error and the classifier error. We evaluated our proposed deep-learning model using publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset collected from 17 different research centers, and include more than 1,035 subjects. Our extensive experimentation demonstrate that ASD-SAENet exhibits comparable accuracy (70.8\%), and superior specificity (79.1\%) for the whole dataset as compared to other methods. Further, our experiments demonstrate superior results as compared to other state-of-the-art methods on 12 out of the 17 imaging centers exhibiting superior generalizability across different data acquisition sites and protocols. The implemented code is available on GitHub portal of our lab at: https://github.com/pcdslab/ASD-SAENet.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder associated with social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Yet, there is no confirmed cause identified for ASD. Studying the functional connectivity of the brain is an emerging technique used in diagnosing and understanding ASD. In this study, we obtained the resting state functional MRI data of 283 subjects from the National Database of Autism Research (NDAR). An automated autism diagnosis system was built using the data from NDAR. The proposed system is machine learning based. Power spectral densities (PSDs) of time courses corresponding to the spatial activation areas are used as input features, feeds them to a stacked autoencoder then builds a classifier using probabilistic support vector machines. Over the used dataset, around 90\% of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was achieved by our machine learning system. Moreover, the system generalization ability was checked over two different prevalence values, one for the general population and the other for the of high risk population, and the system proved to be very generalizable, especially among the population of high risk. The proposed system generates a full personalized report for each subject, along with identifying the global differences between ASD and typically developed (TD) subjects and its ability to diagnose autism. It shows the impacted areas and the severity of implications. From the clinical aspect, this report is considered very valuable as it helps in both predicting and understanding behavior of autistic subjects. Moreover, it helps in designing a plan for personalized treatment per each individual subject. The proposed work is taking a step towards achieving personalized medicine in autism which is the ultimate goal of our group's research efforts in this area.},

  abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) captures the temporal dynamics of neural activity as a function of spatial location in the brain. Thus, fMRI scans are represented as 4-Dimensional (3-space + 1-time) tensors. And it is widely believed that the spatio-temporal patterns in fMRI manifests as behaviour and clinical symptoms. Because of the high dimensionality ({$\sim\sim\backslash$}sim 1 Million) of fMRI, and the added constraints of limited cardinality of data sets, extracting such patterns are challenging. A standard approach to overcome these hurdles is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by either summarizing activation over time or space at the expense of possible loss of useful information. Here, we introduce an end-to-end algorithm capable of extracting spatiotemporal features from the full 4-D data using 3-D CNNs and 3-D Convolutional LSTMs. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available ABIDE dataset to demonstrate the capability of our model to classify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from resting-state fMRI data. Our results show that the proposed model achieves state of the art results on single sites with F1-scores of 0.78 and 0.7 on NYU and UM sites, respectively.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are notoriously difficult to diagnose, especially in children. The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28\% with maximum accuracy of 82\%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods).

ASD is a brain-based disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. According to recent Centers for Disease Control data, ASD affects one in 68 children in the United States. We investigated patterns of functional connectivity that objectively identify ASD participants from functional brain imaging data, and attempted to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from the classification. The results improved the state-of-the-art by achieving 70\% accuracy in identification of ASD versus control patients in the dataset. The patterns that emerged from the classification show an anticorrelation of brain function between anterior and posterior areas of the brain; the anticorrelation corroborates current empirical evidence of anterior-posterior disruption in brain connectivity in ASD. We present the results and identify the areas of the brain that contributed most to differentiating ASD from typically developing controls as per our deep learning model.},

In this study, to classify both control subjects and a large sample of patients with ASD, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and a neural network. Imaging data from 312 subjects with ASD and 328 subjects with typical development was downloaded from the multi-center research project. Only subjects under 20 years of age were included in this analysis. Correlation matrices computed from rs-fMRI time-series data were entered into a probabilistic neural network (PNN) for classification. The PNN classified the two groups with approximately 90\% accuracy (sensitivity~=~92\%, specificity~=~87\%). The accuracy of classification did not differ among the institutes, or with respect to experimental and imaging conditions, sex, handedness, or intellectual level. Medication status and degree of head movement did not affect accuracy values. The present study indicates that an intrinsic connectivity matrix produced from rs-fMRI data could yield a possible biomarker of ASD. These results support the view that altered network connectivity within the brain contributes to the neurobiology of ASD.},

  abstract = {Objective: The larger sample sizes available from multi-site publicly available neuroimaging data repositories makes machine-learning based diagnostic classification of mental disorders more feasible by alleviating the curse of dimensionality. However, since multi-site data are aggregated post-hoc, i.e. they were acquired from different scanners with different acquisition parameters, non-neural inter-site variability may mask inter-group differences that are at least in part neural in origin. Hence, the advantages gained by the larger sample size in the context of machine-learning based diagnostic classification may not be realized. Methods: We address this issue using harmonization of multi-site neuroimaging data using the ComBat technique, which is based on an empirical Bayes formulation to remove inter-site differences in data distributions, to improve diagnostic classification accuracy. Specifically, we demonstrate this using ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) multi-site data for classifying individuals with Autism from healthy controls using resting state fMRI-based functional connectivity data. Results: Our results show that higher classification accuracies across multiple classification models can be obtained (especially for models based on artificial neural networks) from multi-site data post harmonization with the ComBat technique as compared to without harmonization, outperforming earlier results from existing studies using ABIDE. Furthermore, our network ablation analysis facilitated important insights into ASD pathology and the connectivity in networks shown to be important for classification covaried with verbal communication impairments in Autism. Conclusion: Multi-site data harmonization using ComBat improves neuroimaging-based diagnostic classification of mental disorders. Significance: ComBat has the potential to make AI-based clinical decision-support systems more feasible in psychiatry},

In this study, we used the fMRI data of 816 individuals enrolled in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to introduce a new biomarker extraction pipeline for ASD that relies on the use of graph theoretical metrics of fMRI-based functional connectivity to inform a support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, we split the dataset into 5 age groups to account for the effect of aging on functional connectivity.

Our experiments reveal an intriguing trend: On average, models with stochastic parcellations consistently perform as well as models with widely used atlases at the same spatial scale. We thus propose an ensemble learning strategy to combine the predictions from models trained on connectivity data extracted using different (e.g., stochastic) parcellations. We further present an implementation of our ensemble learning strategy with a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach. The proposed CNN approach takes advantage of the full-resolution 3D spatial structure of rs-fMRI data and fits non-linear predictive models. Our ensemble CNN framework overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning models for connectomes that often rely on region-based summary statistics and/or linear models. We showcase our approach on a classification (autism patients versus healthy controls) and a regression problem (prediction of subject's age), and report promising results.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models have shown their advantage in many different tasks, including neuroimage analysis. However, to effectively train a high-quality deep learning model, the aggregation of a significant amount of patient information is required. The time and cost for acquisition and annotation in assembling, for example, large fMRI datasets make it difficult to acquire large numbers at a single site. However, due to the need to protect the privacy of patient data, it is hard to assemble a central database from multiple institutions. Federated learning allows for population-level models to be trained without centralizing entities' data by transmitting the global model to local entities, training the model locally, and then averaging the gradients or weights in the global model. However, some studies suggest that private information can be recovered from the model gradients or weights. In this work, we address the problem of multi-site fMRI classification with a privacy-preserving strategy. To solve the problem, we propose a federated learning approach, where a decentralized iterative optimization algorithm is implemented and shared local model weights are altered by a randomization mechanism. Considering the systemic differences of fMRI distributions from different sites, we further propose two domain adaptation methods in this federated learning formulation. We investigate various practical aspects of federated model optimization and compare federated learning with alternative training strategies. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is promising to utilize multi-site data without data sharing to boost neuroimage analysis performance and find reliable disease-related biomarkers. Our proposed pipeline can be generalized to other privacy-sensitive medical data analysis problems. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xxlya/Fed\_ABIDE/.},

  abstract = {Early diagnosis remains a significant challenge for many neurological disorders, especially for rare disorders where studying large cohorts is not possible. A novel solution that investigators have undertaken is combining advanced machine learning algorithms with resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to unveil hidden pathological brain connectome patterns to uncover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Recently, state-of-the-art deep learning techniques are outperforming traditional machine learning methods and are hailed as a milestone for artificial intelligence. However, whole brain classification that combines brain connectome with deep learning has been hindered by insufficient training samples. Inspired by the transfer learning strategy employed in computer vision, we exploited previously collected resting-state functional MRI data for healthy subjects from existing databases and transferred this knowledge for new disease classification tasks. We developed a deep transfer learning neural network (DTL-NN) framework for enhancing the classification of whole brain functional connectivity patterns. Briefly, we trained a stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) prototype to learn healthy functional connectivity patterns in an offline learning environment. Then, the SSAE prototype was transferred to a DTL-NN model for a new classification task. To test the validity of our framework, we collected resting-state functional MRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repository. Using autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification as a target task, we compared the performance of our DTL-NN approach with a traditional deep neural network and support vector machine models across four ABIDE data sites that enrolled at least 60 subjects. As compared to traditional models, our DTL-NN approach achieved an improved performance in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under receiver operating characteristic curve. These findings suggest that DTL-NN approaches could enhance disease classification for neurological conditions, where accumulating large neuroimaging datasets has been challenging.},

  abstract = {Graphs are widely used as a natural framework that captures interactions between individual elements represented as nodes in a graph. In medical applications, specifically, nodes can represent individuals within a potentially large population (patients or healthy controls) accompanied by a set of features, while the graph edges incorporate associations between subjects in an intuitive manner. This representation allows to incorporate the wealth of imaging and non-imaging information as well as individual subject features simultaneously in disease classification tasks. Previous graph-based approaches for supervised or unsupervised learning in the context of disease prediction solely focus on pairwise similarities between subjects, disregarding individual characteristics and features, or rather rely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors and fail to model interactions between them. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of a generic framework that leverages both imaging and non-imaging information and can be used for brain analysis in large populations. This framework exploits Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and involves representing populations as a sparse graph, where its nodes are associated with imaging-based feature vectors, while phenotypic information is integrated as edge weights. The extensive evaluation explores the effect of each individual component of this framework on disease prediction performance and further compares it to different baselines. The framework performance is tested on two large datasets with diverse underlying data, ABIDE and ADNI, for the prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder and conversion to Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Our analysis shows that our novel framework can improve over state-of-the-art results on both databases, with 70.4\% classification accuracy for ABIDE and 80.0\% for ADNI.},

  abstract = {In the recent 5~years (2014\textendash 2018), there has been growing interest in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to explore image diagnosis and prognosis of therapeutic lesion changes within the area of neuroradiology. However, to date, the majority of research trend and current status have not been clearly illuminated in the neuroradiology field. More than 1000 papers have been published during the past 5~years on subject classification and prediction focused on multiple brain disorders. We provide a survey of 209 papers in this field with a focus on top ten active areas of research; i.e., Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, brain tumor; schizophrenia, depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Detailed information of these studies, such as ML methods, sample size, type of inputted features and reported accuracy, are summarized. This paper reviews the evidences, current limitations and status of studies using ML to assess brain disorders in neuroimaging data. The main bottleneck of this research field is still the limited sample size, which could be potentially addressed by modern data sharing models, such as ADNI.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder that affects the social abilities of patients. Studies have shown that a small number of abnormal functional connections (FCs) exist in the cerebral hemisphere of ASD patients. The identification of these abnormal FCs provides a biological ground for the diagnosis of ASD. In this paper, we propose a combined deep feature selection (DFS) and graph convolutional network method to classify ASD. Firstly, in the DFS process, a sparse one-to-one layer is added between the input and the first hidden layer of a multilayer perceptron, thus each functional connection (FC) feature can be weighted and a subset of FC features can be selected accordingly. Then based on the selected FCs and the phenotypic information of subjects, a graph convolutional network is constructed to classify ASD and typically developed controls. Finally, we test our proposed method on the ABIDE database and compare it with some other methods in the literature. Experimental results indicate that the DFS can effectively select critical FC features for classification according to the weights of input FC features. With DFS, the performance of GCN classifier can be improved dramatically. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 79.5\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85 on the preprocessed ABIDE dataset; it is superior to the other methods. Further studies on the top-ranked thirty FCs obtained by DFS show that these FCs are widespread over the cerebral hemisphere, and the ASD group appears a significantly higher number of weak connections compared to the typically developed group.},

  abstract = {Background: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled significant progress in speech recognition, image classification, automotive software engineering, and neuroscience. This impressive progress is largely due to a combination of algorithmic breakthroughs, computation resource improvements, and access to a large amount of data.Method: In this paper, we focus on the automated detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using CNN with a brain imaging dataset. We detected ASD patients using most common resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a multi-site dataset named the Autism Brain Imaging Exchange (ABIDE). The proposed approach was able to classify ASD and control subjects based on the patterns of functional connectivity.Results: Our experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed model is able to detect ASD correctly with an accuracy of 70.22\% using the ABIDE I dataset and the CC400 functional parcellation atlas of the brain. Also, the CNN model developed used fewer parameters than the state-of-art techniques and is hence computationally less intensive. Our developed model is ready to be tested with more data and can be used to prescreen ASD patients.},

  abstract = {Considering the unsatisfactory classification accuracy of autism due to unsuitable features selected in current studies, a functional connectivity (FC)-based algorithm for classifying autism and control using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is proposed in this paper. The goal is to find the optimal features based on FC and improve the classification accuracy on a large sample of data. We chose 35 regions of interest based on the social motivation hypothesis to construct the FC matrix and searched for informative features in the complex high-dimensional FC dataset by the SVM-RFE with a stratified-4-fold cross-validation strategy. The selected features were then entered into an SVM with a Gaussian kernel for classification. A total of 255 subjects with autism and 276 subjects with typical development from 10 sites were involved in the study. For the data of global sites, the proposed classification algorithm could identify the two groups with an accuracy of 90.60\% (sensitivity 90.62\%, specificity 90.58\%). For the leave-one-site-out test, the proposed algorithm achieved a classification accuracy of 75.00\%\textendash 95.23\% for data from different sites. These promising results demonstrate that the proposed classification algorithm performs better than those in recent similar studies in that the importance of features can be measured accurately and only the most discriminative feature subset is selected.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a wide range of symptoms. Identifying biomarkers for accurate diagnosis is crucial for early intervention of ASD. While multi-site data increase sample size and statistical power, they suffer from inter-site heterogeneity. To address this issue, we propose a multi-site adaption framework via low-rank representation decomposition (maLRR) for ASD identification based on functional MRI (fMRI). The main idea is to determine a common low-rank representation for data from the multiple sites, aiming to reduce differences in data distributions. Treating one site as a target domain and the remaining sites as source domains, data from these domains are transformed (i.e., adapted) to a common space using low-rank representation. To reduce data heterogeneity between the target and source domains, data from the source domains are linearly represented in the common space by those from the target domain. We evaluated the proposed method on both synthetic and real multi-site fMRI data for ASD identification. The results suggest that our method yields superior performance over several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.},

  abstract = {Currently, it is still a great challenge in clinical practice to accurately diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To address this challenge, in this study we propose a method for automatic diagnosis of ASD based on multi-atlas graph convolutional networks and ensemble learning. Firstly, we extract multiple feature representations based on functional connectivity (FC) of different brain atlases from fMRI data of each subject. Then, to obtain the features that are more helpful for ASD automatic diagnosis, we propose a multi-atlas graph convolutional network method (MAGCN). Finally, to combine different feature representations, we propose a stacking ensemble learning method to perform the final ASD automatic diagnostic task. Our proposed method is evaluated on 949 subjects (including 419 subjects with ASD and 530 subjects with typical control (TC)) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 75.86\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8314 for automatic diagnosis of ASD. In addition, compared with some methods published in recent years, our proposed method obtains the best performance of ASD diagnosis. Overall, our proposed method is effective and promising for automatic diagnosis of ASD in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Pattern classification and stratification approaches have increasingly been used in research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) over the last ten years with the goal of translation towards clinical applicability. Here, we present an extensive scoping literature review on those two approaches. We screened a total of 635 studies, of which 57 pattern classification and 19 stratification studies were included. We observed large variance across pattern classification studies in terms of predictive performance from about 60\% to 98\% accuracy, which is among other factors likely linked to sampling bias, different validation procedures across studies, the heterogeneity of ASD and differences in data quality. Stratification studies were less prevalent with only two studies reporting replications and just a few showing external validation. While some identified strata based on cognition and intelligence reappear across studies, biology as a stratification marker is clearly underexplored. In summary, mapping biological differences at the level of the individual with ASD is a major challenge for the field now. Conceptualizing those mappings and individual trajectories that lead to the diagnosis of ASD, will become a major challenge in the near future.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder. Traditional diagnosis of ASD is typically performed through the observation of behaviors and interview of a patient. However, these diagnosis methods are time-consuming and can be misleading sometimes. Integrating machine learning algorithms with neuroimages, a diagnosis method, can possibly be established to detect ASD subjects from typical control subjects. In this study, we develop deep learning methods for diagnosis of ASD from functional brain networks constructed with brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The entire Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange 1 (ABIDE 1) data set is utilized to investigate the performance of our proposed methods. First, we construct the brain networks from brain fMRI images and define the raw features based on such brain networks. Second, we employ an autoencoder (AE) to learn the advanced features from the raw features. Third, we train a deep neural network (DNN) with the advanced features, which achieves the classification accuracy of 76.2\% and the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 79.7\%. As a comparison, we also apply the same advanced features to train several traditional machine learning algorithms to benchmark the classification performance. Finally, we combine the DNN with the pretrained AE and train it with the raw features, which achieves the classification accuracy of 79.2\% and the AUC of 82.4\%. These results show that our proposed deep learning methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},
