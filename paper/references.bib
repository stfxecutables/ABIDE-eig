  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder associated with social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Yet, there is no confirmed cause identified for ASD. Studying the functional connectivity of the brain is an emerging technique used in diagnosing and understanding ASD. In this study, we obtained the resting state functional MRI data of 283 subjects from the National Database of Autism Research (NDAR). An automated autism diagnosis system was built using the data from NDAR. The proposed system is machine learning based. Power spectral densities (PSDs) of time courses corresponding to the spatial activation areas are used as input features, feeds them to a stacked autoencoder then builds a classifier using probabilistic support vector machines. Over the used dataset, around 90\% of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was achieved by our machine learning system. Moreover, the system generalization ability was checked over two different prevalence values, one for the general population and the other for the of high risk population, and the system proved to be very generalizable, especially among the population of high risk. The proposed system generates a full personalized report for each subject, along with identifying the global differences between ASD and typically developed (TD) subjects and its ability to diagnose autism. It shows the impacted areas and the severity of implications. From the clinical aspect, this report is considered very valuable as it helps in both predicting and understanding behavior of autistic subjects. Moreover, it helps in designing a plan for personalized treatment per each individual subject. The proposed work is taking a step towards achieving personalized medicine in autism which is the ultimate goal of our group's research efforts in this area.},

  abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) captures the temporal dynamics of neural activity as a function of spatial location in the brain. Thus, fMRI scans are represented as 4-Dimensional (3-space + 1-time) tensors. And it is widely believed that the spatio-temporal patterns in fMRI manifests as behaviour and clinical symptoms. Because of the high dimensionality ({$\sim\sim\backslash$}sim 1 Million) of fMRI, and the added constraints of limited cardinality of data sets, extracting such patterns are challenging. A standard approach to overcome these hurdles is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by either summarizing activation over time or space at the expense of possible loss of useful information. Here, we introduce an end-to-end algorithm capable of extracting spatiotemporal features from the full 4-D data using 3-D CNNs and 3-D Convolutional LSTMs. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available ABIDE dataset to demonstrate the capability of our model to classify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from resting-state fMRI data. Our results show that the proposed model achieves state of the art results on single sites with F1-scores of 0.78 and 0.7 on NYU and UM sites, respectively.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are notoriously difficult to diagnose, especially in children. The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28\% with maximum accuracy of 82\%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods). The implemented code is available as GPL license on GitHub portal of our lab (https://github.com/pcdslab/ASD-DiagNet).},

We investigated ASD patients brain imaging data from a world-wide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). ASD is a brain-based disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. According to recent Centers for Disease Control data, ASD affects one in 68 children in the United States. We investigated patterns of functional connectivity that objectively identify ASD participants from functional brain imaging data, and attempted to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from the classification. The results improved the state-of-the-art by achieving 70\% accuracy in identification of ASD versus control patients in the dataset. The patterns that emerged from the classification show an anticorrelation of brain function between anterior and posterior areas of the brain; the anticorrelation corroborates current empirical evidence of anterior-posterior disruption in brain connectivity in ASD. We present the results and identify the areas of the brain that contributed most to differentiating ASD from typically developing controls as per our deep learning model.},

In this study, to classify both control subjects and a large sample of patients with ASD, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and a neural network. Imaging data from 312 subjects with ASD and 328 subjects with typical development was downloaded from the multi-center research project. Only subjects under 20 years of age were included in this analysis. Correlation matrices computed from rs-fMRI time-series data were entered into a probabilistic neural network (PNN) for classification. The PNN classified the two groups with approximately 90\% accuracy (sensitivity~=~92\%, specificity~=~87\%). The accuracy of classification did not differ among the institutes, or with respect to experimental and imaging conditions, sex, handedness, or intellectual level. Medication status and degree of head movement did not affect accuracy values. The present study indicates that an intrinsic connectivity matrix produced from rs-fMRI data could yield a possible biomarker of ASD. These results support the view that altered network connectivity within the brain contributes to the neurobiology of ASD.},

They usually rely on pre-identified biomarkers to highlight the existence of certain problems. However, finding such biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has challenged researchers for many years. With enough data and computational power, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to interpret the data and extract the best biomarkers from thousands of candidates. In this study, we used the fMRI data of 816 individuals enrolled in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to introduce a new biomarker extraction pipeline for ASD that relies on the use of graph theoretical metrics of fMRI-based functional connectivity to inform a support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, we split the dataset into 5 age groups to account for the effect of aging on functional connectivity. Our methodology achieved better results than most state-of-the-art investigations on this dataset with the best model for the {$>$}30 years age group achieving an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95, 97, and 95\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Deep learning models have shown their advantage in many different tasks, including neuroimage analysis. However, to effectively train a high-quality deep learning model, the aggregation of a significant amount of patient information is required. The time and cost for acquisition and annotation in assembling, for example, large fMRI datasets make it difficult to acquire large numbers at a single site. However, due to the need to protect the privacy of patient data, it is hard to assemble a central database from multiple institutions. Federated learning allows for population-level models to be trained without centralizing entities' data by transmitting the global model to local entities, training the model locally, and then averaging the gradients or weights in the global model. However, some studies suggest that private information can be recovered from the model gradients or weights. In this work, we address the problem of multi-site fMRI classification with a privacy-preserving strategy. To solve the problem, we propose a federated learning approach, where a decentralized iterative optimization algorithm is implemented and shared local model weights are altered by a randomization mechanism. Considering the systemic differences of fMRI distributions from different sites, we further propose two domain adaptation methods in this federated learning formulation. We investigate various practical aspects of federated model optimization and compare federated learning with alternative training strategies. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is promising to utilize multi-site data without data sharing to boost neuroimage analysis performance and find reliable disease-related biomarkers. Our proposed pipeline can be generalized to other privacy-sensitive medical data analysis problems. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xxlya/Fed\_ABIDE/.},

  abstract = {Early diagnosis remains a significant challenge for many neurological disorders, especially for rare disorders where studying large cohorts is not possible. A novel solution that investigators have undertaken is combining advanced machine learning algorithms with resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to unveil hidden pathological brain connectome patterns to uncover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Recently, state-of-the-art deep learning techniques are outperforming traditional machine learning methods and are hailed as a milestone for artificial intelligence. However, whole brain classification that combines brain connectome with deep learning has been hindered by insufficient training samples. Inspired by the transfer learning strategy employed in computer vision, we exploited previously collected resting-state functional MRI data for healthy subjects from existing databases and transferred this knowledge for new disease classification tasks. We developed a deep transfer learning neural network (DTL-NN) framework for enhancing the classification of whole brain functional connectivity patterns. Briefly, we trained a stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) prototype to learn healthy functional connectivity patterns in an offline learning environment. Then, the SSAE prototype was transferred to a DTL-NN model for a new classification task. To test the validity of our framework, we collected resting-state functional MRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repository. Using autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification as a target task, we compared the performance of our DTL-NN approach with a traditional deep neural network and support vector machine models across four ABIDE data sites that enrolled at least 60 subjects. As compared to traditional models, our DTL-NN approach achieved an improved performance in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under receiver operating characteristic curve. These findings suggest that DTL-NN approaches could enhance disease classification for neurological conditions, where accumulating large neuroimaging datasets has been challenging.},

  abstract = {Graphs are widely used as a natural framework that captures interactions between individual elements represented as nodes in a graph. In medical applications, specifically, nodes can represent individuals within a potentially large population (patients or healthy controls) accompanied by a set of features, while the graph edges incorporate associations between subjects in an intuitive manner. This representation allows to incorporate the wealth of imaging and non-imaging information as well as individual subject features simultaneously in disease classification tasks. Previous graph-based approaches for supervised or unsupervised learning in the context of disease prediction solely focus on pairwise similarities between subjects, disregarding individual characteristics and features, or rather rely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors and fail to model interactions between them. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of a generic framework that leverages both imaging and non-imaging information and can be used for brain analysis in large populations. This framework exploits Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and involves representing populations as a sparse graph, where its nodes are associated with imaging-based feature vectors, while phenotypic information is integrated as edge weights. The extensive evaluation explores the effect of each individual component of this framework on disease prediction performance and further compares it to different baselines. The framework performance is tested on two large datasets with diverse underlying data, ABIDE and ADNI, for the prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder and conversion to Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Our analysis shows that our novel framework can improve over state-of-the-art results on both databases, with 70.4\% classification accuracy for ABIDE and 80.0\% for ADNI.},

Detailed information of these studies, such as ML methods, sample size, type of inputted features and reported accuracy, are summarized. This paper reviews the evidences, current limitations and status of studies using ML to assess brain disorders in neuroimaging data.

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder that affects the social abilities of patients. Studies have shown that a small number of abnormal functional connections (FCs) exist in the cerebral hemisphere of ASD patients. The identification of these abnormal FCs provides a biological ground for the diagnosis of ASD. In this paper, we propose a combined deep feature selection (DFS) and graph convolutional network method to classify ASD. Firstly, in the DFS process, a sparse one-to-one layer is added between the input and the first hidden layer of a multilayer perceptron, thus each functional connection (FC) feature can be weighted and a subset of FC features can be selected accordingly. Then based on the selected FCs and the phenotypic information of subjects, a graph convolutional network is constructed to classify ASD and typically developed controls. Finally, we test our proposed method on the ABIDE database and compare it with some other methods in the literature. Experimental results indicate that the DFS can effectively select critical FC features for classification according to the weights of input FC features. With DFS, the performance of GCN classifier can be improved dramatically. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 79.5\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85 on the preprocessed ABIDE dataset; it is superior to the other methods. Further studies on the top-ranked thirty FCs obtained by DFS show that these FCs are widespread over the cerebral hemisphere, and the ASD group appears a significantly higher number of weak connections compared to the typically developed group.},
