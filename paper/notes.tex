\begin{abstract}
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has considerable potential
  for predicting neuropsychological and neurophysiological disorders. However, processing this data
  for use in machine learning (ML) and/or deep learning (DL) algorithms is challenging. In this
  paper we implement both novel deep learning architectures and a preprocessing step for converting
  fMRI images into spatially-rich 4D summary images with the same or greater predictive potential as
  the raw fMRI. We show that tuned models on these summary "eigen-perturbation" images are just as
  accurate as on the fMRI original images, despite a \(10-20\) times reduction in size, and achieve
  state-of-the-art accuracy of [over 70\% we hope!] on a \emph{large}, cross-site validation set.
